# House Price Analysis & Insights

## Description 
This project gives a better understanding of house prices. A presentation that investigates which house features affect house price, derives a model that can predict house pricing, and uncovers 3 concrete features that highly influence house prices. Findings from both the project and presentation are for people interested in seeing whether certain features will affect house price (or not), accurately and precisely placing prices on houses, and grouping houses with specific features in specific budget ranges.



## Where to Start First:

### 1. Access the [Table of Content](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JohnPaulHernandezAlcala/House_Sale_Prices/blob/master/Table%20of%20Content.ipynb) for navigation and a breakdown of the analysis process.
NOTE: For full navigation abilities, open up Table of Content in Jupyter Notebook.
### 2. Follow along with the coding narrative and comments.
### 3. Preview the uploaded presentation, [House Price Analysis & Insights](https://github.com/JohnPaulHernandezAlcala/House_Sale_Prices/blob/master/House%20Price%20Analysis%20%26%20Insights.pdf).

## Conclusion
With all the features, we built a model with multiple linear regression. This model was evaluated for performance and found to have an accuracy of 83.45% and a high precision (low error). Because of the high accuracy and precision of this model, we can identify three concrete features (also known as coefficients) that highly influence housing prices: Bathrooms, Grade and Zip Code.

## Recommended Uses for the Model:
* Allows housing developments to see which features in houses will see higher, lower, or negligible effects on house price based on model coefficients.
* Allows sellers to accurately and precisely place prices on houses
* Allows placements of houses with specific features in specific budget ranges for buyers
